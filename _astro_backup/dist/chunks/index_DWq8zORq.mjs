						const body = "\nOver the past year, I’ve spent countless 1:1s reflecting on work, team dynamics, stress, and growth. And what I’ve come to realize is this:\n\nA good EM isn’t just a manager of tasks—they’re a **guardian of culture, a mirror for growth, and a shield from chaos.**\n\nkinda wild how much trust and support i’ve been getting?? like it’s not just “weekly syncs” — it feels like this ongoing conversation where i get to show up as me, not just “the dev who ships stuff.” here’s a brain dump of what i noticed:\n\n## 🚪 They make space for Real Talk™\n\ni’ve said some pretty raw stuff in these convos. like straight up:\n\n- i didn’t learn anything from that core skills thing.”\n- i don’t want to work like this.”\n- why is Lenny project managing the entire company???”\n\n… and instead of getting weird or defensive, my EM actually listens?? 😭 like i can vent, be confused, celebrate, whatever. no judgment. it feels safe. and tbh i didn’t realize how rare that is until i started writing this post.\n\n## 🛠️ They don’t micromanage (thank god)\n\nthis one's big. i don’t get assigned 10 Jira tickets and a playbook. instead it’s like:\n\n- “write webdriver tester”\n- “make a PD for that.”\n- “push for search”\n- “book a meeting”\n\naka: just go for it. they trust me to figure stuff out, even if it gets messy. and i like that. i wanna work like that. i’m a chaotic little doer and they’re not trying to tame me 🧃\n\n## 🤔 They ask the Big Questions\n\nstuff like:\n\n- “what do you need to focus on?”\n- \"why are you doing this/that?\n- “how do you want to be seen on other teams?”\n- “what do you wish I asked you more often?”\n- “what do you need to focus on?”\n\nlike whoa. we’re not just doing sprint planning here — we’re actually zooming out. and it helps me reflect on the why, not just the what. i’m not just coding features, i’m building a career.\n\n## ⚙️ They care about how we work, not just output\n\nsome people just wanna ship. my EM? they’re out here talking about:\n\n- Sustainable planning (aka not agency-style chaos)\n- Better meetings\n- Fixing workflows that suck\n- Team stress and energy (!!)\n\nit’s giving “systems thinker.” like yeah, let’s actually make work feel good, not just productive.\n\n## 🧃 They still show up, even when it’s a mess\n\nthey’ve had rough weeks too — stressed, overwhelmed, trying to hold it all together. but they still:\n\n- Make time for 1:1s\n- Read my longass reflections 😅\n- Try to fix broken processes (even if it’s not their job… “why is Lenny fixing video??” lmao)\n- Push stuff forward anyway (“OKRs”, “roadmap”, “learn together” etc)\n\nthat kind of steady energy? rare!\n\n## 👀 They actually see me — and challenge me\n\ni’ve heard stuff like:\n\n- “You work a lot alone”\n- “Get more involved with the team”\n- “Share more knowledge” (ouch but true)\n- “You’re a doer”\n- “You have strong frontend skills”\n\nso it’s not just “you’re doing great!!” — it’s like “you’re great and here’s where you can grow.” and i love that. i don’t want to coast. i wanna level up and they’re nudging me there.\n\n## 🌊 They make a real impact\n\nthis isn’t just someone who runs meetings or unblocks Jira tickets. you feel their presence in the way the team moves. the vibes? steadier. the planning? clearer. the people? more open, more honest, more in it together.\n\nlenny’s impact isn’t loud or flashy — it’s consistent. it’s cultural. it’s how chaos feels a little more manageable. how ideas actually turn into action. how i show up to work feeling like what i do matters. and that doesn’t happen by accident. that’s leadership.\n\n## 🧠 They make me think deeper\n\nLenny’s a “but why?” person — in the best way. not to poke holes, but to get to the heart of things.\n\n“why this feature?” “why now?” “why this way of working?”\n\nthey’re not looking for the “right” answer. they’re nudging me to slow down, zoom out, and connect the dots. like — what’s the bigger picture here? what’s the real problem we’re solving? it’s not just about building fast — it’s about building with intention. and that shift? it changes everything.\n\n---\n\n### so yeah, this EM’s the real deal\n\nwhy do i like them so much? maybe because they:\n\n- trust me\n- support my messy growth\n- welcome feedback (even spicy takes)\n- give me space to lead things my way\n- help me pause + reflect\n- care about team vibes, not just velocity\n- gently push me toward leadership without being all “so when are you becoming senior??”\n\nbasically: they treat me like a full human, not just an engineer. and that’s kinda everything 💛\n\n---\n\nSo now you know Lenny Erlesand , why i think you are a great EM! And for showing that leadership isn’t about authority—it’s about impact.\nYou’ve helped me grow—not just as an engineer, but as a teammate and a future leader. And I think that's the highest compliment I can give.\n\nok that’s the post. go hug your EM if you’re lucky to have one like this. or at least send a nice Slack message 💬💫\n";
