Classic.\n\n---\n\n## The Idea (aka: what was I thinking?)\n\nI didn't want a skills test.\nNo quizzes like _\"what does this JavaScript output?\"_ (trauma 😭).\n\nI wanted something more **psychological**.\nSomething that feels like real dev life.\n\nEvery question forces a trade-off:\n\n- ship fast vs build it right\n- explore vs maintain\n- solo grinding vs team collaboration\n\nYour answers slowly pull you toward one of **12 developer archetypes** like:\n\n- **The Ship It** 🚀\n- **The Detective** 🕵️\n- **The Craftsman** 🛠️\n- (yes, Architecture Astronaut is there too 👀)\n\nNo \"right\" answers. Just vibes.\n\n## 💡 Inspiration\n\nThis assessment was inspired by the article [The 12 Developer Mindsets I've Seen in My Career](https://dev.to/notadevbuthere/the-12-developer-mindsets-ive-seen-in-my-career-and-what-they-teach-us-about-building-software-42de) by [@notadevbuthere](https://dev.to/notadevbuthere). The archetypes and core concepts are based on real developer behaviors and patterns observed in software teams.\n\n---\n\n## The Stack (kept it simple, promise)\n\nI didn't want backend drama. No auth. No DB. No servers.\nJust frontend fun.\n\n- **React + Vite** – fast, clean, no pain\n- **React Router** – with `HashRouter` because GitHub Pages 😅\n- **Pure CSS** – no Tailwind, no frameworks, just vibes and CSS variables\n- **html2canvas** – for downloading results as images (this was surprisingly fun)\n\nThat's it. No magic. No enterprise nonsense.\n\n---\n\n## Cool Stuff I'm Proud Of ✨\n\n### 🧠 Smart-ish Scoring\n\nEach answer gives **weighted points** to multiple archetypes.\n\nSo you're not just \"one thing\".\nThe algorithm can notice stuff like:\n\n> \"huh, this person scores high in _Ship It_ AND _Craftsman_… interesting tension 👀\"\n\nIt actually felt like teaching the app to understand personalities. Kinda creepy. Kinda cool.\n\n---\n\n### 🔗 Shareable Results & Download\n\nResults are encoded into the URL using base64.\nNo backend needed – just pure frontend magic ✨\n\nWhich means:\n\n- share the link and anyone can see your result\n- no retaking the test\n- no database, no servers, my wallet is happy\n- download your result as a PNG\n- share directly to LinkedIn (yes, devs love this stuff)\n\nEncoding state into the URL turned out to be insanely powerful. Sharing just works™ and I wanted it to feel like an **achievement unlock** 🎖️, not just text on a screen.\n\n---\n\n## The Questions (harder than coding tbh)\n\n20 questions.\n4 answers each.\n\nThis part took the longest.\n\nEach answer had to:\n\n- feel _real_\n- map clearly to personality traits\n- not scream \"THIS IS THE CORRECT ANSWER\" 🙃\n\nExample question:\n\n> **You find a messy file that somehow works. What do you do?**\n\n- Rewrite it from scratch (perfectionist)\n- Ship features and move on (pragmatic)\n- Understand why it works first (detective)\n- Refactor slowly over time (balanced dev)\n\nIf you read that and felt _personally attacked_… good 😈\n\n---\n\n## Things I Learned (aka: bugs taught me stuff)\n\n### 🔑 React keys REALLY matter\n\nI had a weird bug where answers from one question leaked into another.\n\nTurns out:\n\n```js\nkey={answer.id}\n```\n\nwas NOT enough.\n\nFix:\n\n```js\nkey={`${question.id}-${answer.id}`}\n```\n\nReact stopped gaslighting me immediately.\n\n---\n\n### ⏱️ Tiny delays = better UX\n\nThat 300ms pause after clicking an answer?\n\nRemove it and the app feels broken.\nAdd it and suddenly everything feels intentional.\n\nUX is wild.\n\n---\n\n## Stats (because devs love numbers)\n\n- 20 questions\n- 12 archetypes\n- ~5 minutes\n- 0 backend servers\n- Hosted on GitHub Pages\n- Built in 2 hours\n\n---\n\n## Try It 👇\n\n👉 **Take the test:**\n[https://ehsanpo.github.io/developertype/](https://ehsanpo.github.io/developertype/)\n\n👉 **Open source on GitHub:**\n[https://github.com/ehsanpo/developertype](https://github.com/ehsanpo/developertype)\n\nIf you try it, tell me what type you got 👀\nAnd if you read this far… wow. You're definitely not \"The Ship It\" 😅\n\nBuilt for fun. Learned a ton.\nHighly recommend building weird little projects like this.\n\nNow excuse me while I add _one more feature_ that I definitely don't need. 🚀\n\n![Developer Type Assessment Screenshot](./developer-type-calm-senior.png)\n";
