It started as a “let’s just see what happens” experiment and turned into a surprisingly fun rabbit hole.\n\nYou can actually hear one of my chaotic little audio creatures here:\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1172751727&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false\"></iframe>\n\n_(yes, that’s one of my generative music tests — don’t judge me 😬)_\n\n---\n\n## From Music to Visuals 🎶➡️🎨\n\nAfter spending way too many nights tweaking synth patches, I started thinking… what if I did the same thing visually? Like, **generative art** but for my eyeballs instead of my ears.\n\nSo I did what any normal person would do: opened ten browser tabs, fell into a GitHub hole, and discovered people making wild generative visuals in **R**, **Go**, and **Python**.\n\nAnd wow. The stuff people do with just a few lines of code is _ridiculous_.\n\n---\n\n## Setting Things Up (a.k.a. The Java Saga)\n\nNaturally, I decided to try it myself. Installed **R**. Then installed **Processing 3** on my Mac.\nAnd… yeah, that was a disaster. 🙃\n\nProcessing 3 and Java apparently have beef, because nothing worked. After a few hours of debugging (and a small existential crisis), I rolled back to **Processing v2** and — hallelujah! — it worked.\n\nCircles appeared! Pretty ones!\n\nHonestly, at that point, I didn’t even care _how_ it worked. I just wanted to make cool visuals and pretend I was an algorithmic artist.\n\n---\n\n## The Results (woohoo! 🎉)\n\nHere’s a few of the patterns I made:\n\n![Circular generative art with overlapping patterns](./circle-8+10.png)\n_Complex overlapping circles that look like they’re plotting something_\n\n![Simple circular pattern](./circle-1.png)\n_Minimalist and chill_\n\n![Geometric circular design](./circle-2.png)\n_Geometric perfection vibes_\n\n![Organic circular pattern](./circle-5.png)\n_Kinda flowy, kinda alive_\n\n![Dense circular pattern](./circle-6.png)\n_Dense and slightly overwhelming (like my brain on coffee)_\n\n![Radiating circles](./circle-7.png)\n_Sunburst-y and dramatic_\n\n![Nested circles](./circle-8.png)\n_Like circles inside circles inside circles..._\n\n![Dynamic circular composition](./circle-9.png)\n_Looks like it might start spinning if I stare too long_\n\n---\n\n## What I Learned (aka why circles are secretly deep)\n\n### 💡 The Beauty of Algorithms\n\nEven though it was all circles, every image turned out _so different_.\nLike:\n\n- **Precise math** vs. **random chaos**\n- **Dense complexity** vs. **clean minimalism**\n- **Overlapping madness** vs. **perfect geometry**\n\nIt’s wild how much personality a few lines of code can have.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Processing vs. R\n\nSo I played around with both:\n\n- **Processing** → felt way more natural for visuals. You draw, you tweak, you see results instantly.\n- **R** → more technical but sooo good if you want mathematical control.\n- Both communities are super active and helpful (thank you, random forum strangers 🙏).\n\n---\n\n### 🎨 Creativity Through Constraints\n\nHere’s the funny thing — when I limited myself to **just circles**, I got _way_ more creative. Like, weirdly so.\n\nBy only tweaking stuff like:\n\n- size\n- opacity\n- color gradients\n- how they overlap or intersect\n- little position algorithms\n\n…I ended up with endless variations. Turns out “less is more” actually works sometimes (who knew?).\n\n---\n\n## My Tech Setup (for the curious nerds 👩‍💻)\n\n**What worked:**\n\n- Processing 2 (don’t ask me about v3 😩)\n- Basic geometry functions\n- Simple random() stuff\n- Layer blending (chef’s kiss)\n\n**My super scientific process:**\n\n1. Draw a circle.\n2. Randomize everything.\n3. Go “hmm, interesting.”\n4. Add color + opacity.\n5. Layer it a bunch until it looks artsy.\n6. Screenshot it before it breaks.\n\n---\n\n## Why I Love Generative Art 💖\n\nIt’s that **element of surprise**. You give the computer rules, and it goes, “cool, but what if I did this instead?”\n\nYou’re not _making_ the art — you’re _collaborating_ with the algorithm. It’s half you, half the machine, and 100% unexpected.\n\nEvery image feels both planned and chaotic at the same time. Like art with a mind of its own.\n\n---\n\nSo yeah — what started as a music experiment turned into me falling in love with algorithmic circles.\n\nWho needs perfection when you have randomness, right? 😉\n\n_(P.S. If you’ve made generative art, please share! I love seeing what other curious nerds create ❤️)_\n";
