I learned to be very careful about how often I ask for location updates.</p>\n<p><strong>Test on actual crappy phones:</strong>\nThe simulator lies about EVERYTHING location-related. That fancy iPhone 15 Pro in the simulator? Not representative of your kid’s hand-me-down Android with 47% battery and spotty connection.</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy by design is hard but worth it:</strong>\nIt’s so much easier to just collect everything and figure out privacy later.

Right now it does exactly what my wife asked for. Kids can share their location when walking home from school. We can see where everyone is on a simple map.

But where’s the fun in that? 🤪</p>\n<p>Building your own solution means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You control the privacy</strong> - No mysterious data collection</li>\n<li><strong>You learn tons</strong> - Real-time apps, location services, database design</li>\n<li><strong>You can customize everything</strong> - Want purple circles?

Right now, let me tell you about the absolute rollercoaster of building this thing...\n\n---\n\n## Why I Went Full \"Privacy Paranoid Parent\" Mode\n\nOkay, so after looking at all these tracking apps, I realized they're basically just data harvesting machines disguised as family safety tools.

Everyone can see everyone else on a map\n\nWhy circles instead of just \"family\"? Well, our extended family situation is... let's call it \"dynamic\" 😅\n\nSometimes we want to share location with grandparents. Sometimes it's just immediate family. Sometimes it's the whole cousin crew when we're planning a BBQ. Circles let you have different groups without the family drama!\n\nPlus each circle gets its own color on the map. So your \"School Pickup\" circle shows up as blue dots, your \"Weekend Plans\" circle is green, etc. Visual organization for the win! 🎨\n\n---\n\n## Expo + Supabase: The Dream Team I Didn't Know I Needed\n\nI've been team Expo for years now.

There's a big red button for that!\n\n**No tracking by default:**\n\n- App literally can't see your location unless you actively join a circle\n- Even then, only people in YOUR specific circles can see you\n- No \"oops we were tracking everyone accidentally\" nonsense\n\nI'm even thinking of adding an \"invisible mode\" where you can see others but they can't see you. For those times when you need to be... strategically unavailable 😏\n\n---\n\n## Web Version: The Accidental MVP\n\nOriginally, I built the web version just for testing. Didn't want to keep deploying to my phone every time I changed something.\n\nBut it turned out to be super useful! Think about it:\n\n- At work and want to check where everyone is? Open a browser tab\n- Need to approve someone joining a circle? Easier on a big screen\n- Older family members prefer using computers sometimes\n\nMy dad actually uses the web version more than the mobile app! He bookmarked it and everything. Technology wins! 💻\n\nThe web version can't do background tracking (browser limitations), but it's perfect for:\n\n- Quick location checks\n- Admin stuff (creating circles, approving members)\n- Testing without draining your phone battery\n\n---\n\n## What I Learned (The Hard Way)\n\n**Location permissions are user experience hell:**\nI probably spent more time on the permission flow than the actual tracking. Android makes you ask for like 6 different location permissions, and if users say no to any of them, your app becomes useless.\n\n**Real-time is really hard:**\nWebSockets, reconnection logic, offline handling, syncing when you come back online... There's a reason why companies have entire teams dedicated to this stuff!\n\n**Battery life is everything:**\nCool features mean nothing if they kill your phone by lunchtime. I learned to be very careful about how often I ask for location updates.\n\n**Test on actual crappy phones:**\nThe simulator lies about EVERYTHING location-related. That fancy iPhone 15 Pro in the simulator? Not representative of your kid's hand-me-down Android with 47% battery and spotty connection.\n\n**Privacy by design is hard but worth it:**\nIt's so much easier to just collect everything and figure out privacy later. But building it in from the start means you never have to have those awkward \"we accidentally stored everyone's data for 10 years\" conversations.\n\n---\n\n## What's Next? (Feature Creep Incoming!)\n\nOh boy, do I have ideas:\n\n- **iOS support** - Obviously! Just need to figure out Apple's developer program (and pay the $99/year toll 💸)\n- **Smart notifications** - \"Kid arrived at school\" or \"Everyone's home safe\"\n- **Geofences** - Alert when someone leaves a specific area\n- **Better offline handling** - Queue up location updates when connection is spotty\n- **Location history** - Maybe a simple timeline view?\n\nBut honestly? Right now it does exactly what my wife asked for. Kids can share their location when walking home from school. We can see where everyone is on a simple map. Mission accomplished! 🎯\n\nSometimes the best solution is the simplest one.\n\n---\n\n## Why I'm Sharing This (And You Should Build Stuff Too!)\n\nI could have just used Life360 or Find My Friends and called it a day. But where's the fun in that? 🤪\n\nBuilding your own solution means:\n\n- **You control the privacy** - No mysterious data collection\n- **You learn tons** - Real-time apps, location services, database design\n- **You can customize everything** - Want purple circles? Done!\n- **It's actually fun** - Even when it's frustrating\n\nThe code is up on [GitHub](https://github.com/ehsanpo/tracking-app) if you want to check it out. Fair warning: it's very much a work-in-progress and probably has bugs I haven't discovered yet!\n\nBut that's okay! Perfect is the enemy of shipped, as they say.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to go convince my kids to actually test this thing... Wish me luck! 🤞\n";
