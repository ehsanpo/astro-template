Enter [**Wavepaper**](https://github.com/DeanIsMe/Wavepaper_Release) — a tool for creating dreamy, flowing wave patterns. It’s like if math and the ocean had a baby.\n\n---\n\n## The Wave Experiments\n\n![Smooth flowing waves with gradient](./1.png)\n_Smooth and gradient-y_\n\n![Intersecting wave patterns](./2.png)\n_Overlapping chaos that somehow works_\n\n![Minimal wave design](./3.png)\n_Minimal, calm, clean_\n\n![Complex wave interference](./8.png)\n_When waves argue but make art_\n\n---\n\n## Playing With Wavepaper\n\nWavepaper made things super easy: no code, just sliders and instant visuals. I messed with:\n\n- **Frequency** (tight vs. loose waves)\n- **Amplitude** (calm vs. dramatic)\n- **Colors** and **layering** for mood\n\nThe tiniest tweaks changed everything. Some of my best results came from total accidents 😅\n\n---\n\n## What I Learned\n\n- Simple settings often look the best\n- Layering adds depth and movement\n- Color totally sets the emotion\n- Happy glitches = bonus art\n\nWaves feel connected to generative music — both use math to make something _alive_.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Next\n\nI’m dreaming of:\n\n- **Animated waves**\n- **Interactive versions**\n- Maybe combining **circles + waves** for a geometric/organic hybrid\n\n---\n\nWorking with waves has been oddly meditative — less precision, more flow. It reminds me that coding can be creative, and math can actually _feel_ beautiful.\n\n_(Got wave art or generative experiments? Drop them — I’d love to see what you’re making!)_\n";
