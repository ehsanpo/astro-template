At the time I didn't think much of it — I was just trying to understand how machines think without exploding 💥 (spoiler: they're very unforgiving).\n\nFast-forward to me learning **React**, sitting in front of my laptop at 2am, te cold, brain fried, staring at `useState` like it personally offended me.\n\nAnd then…\n💡 _WAIT A SECOND._\n\nThis feels… familiar???\n\n---\n\n## 🏭 PLC brain activated\n\nIf you've ever touched PLC programming (ladder logic, function blocks, whatever flavor), you know the deal:\n\n- Inputs come in (buttons, sensors, signals)\n- Logic runs every cycle\n- Outputs change based on the current state\n- Everything is **predictable**, **reactive**, and **stateful**\n\nBack then I didn't call it \"state\".\nI called it \"why is this motor still ON???\" 😭\n\nBut yeah, PLCs are basically:\n\n> **Infinite loops that react to changes**\n\nSound familiar yet?\n\n---\n\n## ⚛️ Enter React (aka \"PLC but with JSX\")\n\nWhen I first learned React, I was like:\n\n> \"Why is my UI not updating??\n> Why is this state stale??\n> Why is everything re-rendering?? omg\"\n\nClassic beginner pain. Been there. Still there sometimes.\n\nThen I realized something embarrassing:\n\n**React is just automation logic wearing a hoodie.**\n\nHear me out 👇\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 PLC Scan Cycle = React Render Cycle\n\nIn PLCs:\n\n1. Read inputs\n2. Execute logic\n3. Update outputs\n4. Repeat forever ♾️\n\nIn React:\n\n1. State/props change\n2. Component re-renders\n3. UI updates\n4. Repeat forever ♾️\n\nBRO.\n\nSame movie. Different actors.\n\nExcept React yells at you if you mutate state\nand PLCs yell at you by breaking real machines 🫠\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 State is just memory (stop overthinking it)\n\nIn PLC land:\n\n- You store flags\n- You latch bits\n- You remember what happened last cycle\n\nIn React:\n\n- `useState`\n- `useReducer`\n- `useRef` (aka \"pls don't re-render\" button)\n\nSame idea.\nDifferent syntax.\nMore memes.\n\nOnce I stopped treating React state like magic and started treating it like **PLC memory**, everything clicked.\n\nLike:\n\n- A button click = digital input\n- `setState` = coil energizing\n- Conditional rendering = contacts opening/closing\n\nI felt so smart for like 3 minutes 😂\n\n---\n\n## 🎮 Building an interactive story (because why not?)\n\nSo naturally, instead of just understanding this quietly like a normal person…\n\nI built a tiny interactive thing.\n\nAn app where:\n\n- Inputs toggle state\n- Logic decides what happens next\n- UI reacts visually\n\nBasically a **PLC simulator disguised as a React app**.\n\nWas it overkill? Yes.\nDid it help me learn? BIG YES.\nDid I push it to GitHub at 3am with a messy commit message? Absolutely.\n\n---\n\n## 😵 My struggles (aka honesty time)\n\nLet's be real:\n\n- I broke stuff\n- I misunderstood hooks\n- I forgot dependencies in `useEffect` (don't judge me)\n- I re-rendered the universe by accident\n\nMultiple times.\n\nBut that's kinda the point, right?\nI'm just a curious dev smashing concepts together and seeing what survives 🔥\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Why this mindset helped me\n\nThinking in **automation logic** made React less scary.\n\nInstead of:\n\n> \"React is confusing\"\n\nIt became:\n\n> \"Oh, this is just reactive logic with prettier outputs\"\n\nAnd that mindset shift?\nGame changer.\n\nIf you come from:\n\n- PLCs\n- Arduino\n- Game dev\n- Even Excel formulas 😅\n\nYou already understand React more than you think.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Final thoughts (before I overthink this)\n\nIf you're learning React and feel stuck:\n\n- Build weird things\n- Compare it to stuff you already know\n- Don't wait to \"feel ready\"\n\nJust do it™️.\n\nWorst case?\nYou learn something.\nBest case?\nYou accidentally connect factories to frontends and feel like a wizard 🧙‍♂️✨\n\nAlright, I'll stop here before this turns into a book.\nThanks for reading, Now go break something and learn 💙\n";
