## Thoughtful Details

- Preserves your selection context during conversion
- Works with both individual values and batch selections
- Maintains formatting structure in your existing code
- Lightweight extension with zero dependencies

## Built For

**Frontend Developers** working with design systems who need consistent pixel-to-REM conversions while building with Tailwind CSS.

**Design-to-Code Teams** translating Figma or Sketch designs into responsive web interfaces with precise spacing and sizing.

**Web Developers** modernizing legacy codebases by converting pixel values to scalable REM units and utility-first CSS patterns.

## Why This Extension Exists

Modern web development requires scalable designs that adapt to user preferences and diverse viewing contexts. Pixel values create rigid layouts that don't respond to user font size settings or device variations.

This extension bridges the gap between design tools that output pixel values and development workflows that demand responsive, accessible code. It eliminates the manual calculation step that slows down implementation and introduces conversion errors.

## Why Choose This Solution

Focused specifically on the Tailwind CSS ecosystem rather than generic unit conversion. Understands the framework's spacing system and provides contextually relevant suggestions.

Built for Visual Studio Code integration, working directly within your existing workflow without requiring external tools or browser tabs. Designed to feel native to your development environment.

Handles the complexity of Tailwind's naming conventions and spacing scale, so you don't need to memorize which pixel values map to which utility classes.

## Get Started

Install from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace and begin converting pixel values immediately. No configuration required for standard workflows, with customization available for specific project needs.
