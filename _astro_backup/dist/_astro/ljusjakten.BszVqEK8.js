 <h2>Ljus Jakten: A Case Study in HTML5 Geo-Based Game Development for Öresundskraft</h2>
  <p>
    Ljus Jakten was an exciting project undertaken for Öresundskraft to promote their upcoming product, the "district heating plant," in the city of Ängelholm, Sweden. The objective was to engage users through an HTML5 geo-based game, where players had to visit specific locations marked on a map to collect three different symbols, thus earning a chance to win a prize. This case study outlines the process of developing Ljus Jakten, showcasing the game's concept, technical implementation, and the impact it had on Öresundskraft's marketing campaign.
