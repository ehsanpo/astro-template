<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>
  For Björnekulla, I developed a front-end solution to create an interactive 3D, rotatable product image. This solution allowed users to view products from all angles by rotating them directly on the website, enhancing user engagement and showcasing the product in a dynamic way.

  <li>3D interactive product visualization built with jQuery and JavaScript.</li>
