As if that wasn't enough, Ehsan is always keeping up with the latest toolkits and frameworks, learning in his spare time and finding ways to put his new knowledge to use at work.  
 Ehsan is never afraid of a challenge, and will happily take on on tasks that might seem daunting to others. He was always first to jump on the problem when our complicated build system acted up, and even when others were dealing with the issues, he was happy to volunteer to help. When Ehsan was around, we could always be confident that our issues would get solved.  
 Ehsan is also great at taking care of the team and contributing to our sense of community. When we were left without a manager for a time, Ehsan stepped up to lead discussions and plan meetings. When we had concerns about things, Ehsan would be the one to address them and make sure the right people heard them. And even though he's not afraid to deal with serious topics, he's also a real fun guy who brightens the office with his presence and we had plenty of laughs together. 
 One thing I always liked about Ehsan was how he'd share his knowledge and findings with the team. Ehsan makes sure to stay at the forefront of modern technology and keeps the rest of us in the loop. If you read about a new AI tool, Ehsan has probably already tested and evaluated it, and knows if it's worth your time and money. He'd often do little presentations about these things to the team, helping us all improve our workflows and productivity.

Ehsan is a highly experienced engineer with strong technical expertise across both front-end and back-end development. 
 Throughout our collaboration, he consistently demonstrated deep technical knowledge and a proactive mindset. He often took the lead on new initiatives and helped establish effective ways of working within the team. Ehsan regularly kept the team up to date with the latest technical trends and best practices, and he also shared valuable insights on how AI-driven development can improve team productivity and overall performance. 
 He was a key contributor to project planning and technical decision-making, always engaging in thoughtful and well-reasoned technical discussions that led to sound and pragmatic decisions. 
 Beyond his technical capabilities, Ehsan is an excellent team player with strong professional values. He is always willing to support his teammates and consistently makes himself available when help is needed. His collaborative nature and reliability make him a valuable asset to any team.

During that time, he consistently proved to be one of the most reliable, thoughtful, and principled teammates I’ve worked with. 
 One of the things that stands out most about him is his strong sense of ownership. Whether it was planning upcoming work, breaking down complex tasks, or ensuring that we stayed aligned as a team, he always took initiative and pushed our projects forward with clarity and structure. He played a huge role in making sure we kept our documentation in good shape—something that had a real, long-term impact on the maintainability of our codebase.
 He’s also someone who brings a lot of honesty and integrity to discussions. He is never afraid to speak up, challenge assumptions, or offer a different perspective. And even in cases where the team decided on a direction he personally disagreed with, he would still put in the work needed to make the solution succeed. That combination of high moral standards, transparency, and responsibility is rare and incredibly valuable.
 Another strength I really appreciated was his innovative mindset. He constantly explored new technologies, shared knowledge with the team, and helped us adopt better tools and practices. His curiosity and willingness to teach others made a big difference in how our team evolved. 
 Beyond all the technical excellence, he’s simply a great colleague—supportive, dependable, and someone you can trust both in day-to-day work and during high-pressure moments.

And let me tell you – I don’t think I’ve ever met someone as passionate and knowledgeable about “everything code” as him! Working with Ehsan means constantly being introduced to new ideas and interesting innovations. It’s about being challenged (in a good way!) in your ways of thinking, to find creative and efficient solutions to complex problems, and being confident that the code your team produces will adhere to best practices. But above all, it’s an absolute blast. Ehsan possesses the ability to see the whole picture, which enables him to produce quality products – even if the brief is a bit fuzzy. He has an eagerness to share his expertise and has, on countless occasions, made both our team and our department better by doing so. He also has a keen eye for design, which has made my job as a designer so much easier. Replacing him in our team will be a struggle, and I do hope our professional paths cross again in the future. To anyone who has the opportunity to work with him: I’m jealous."},{id:4,name:"Timothy Alexis Vass",title:"System Developer at Bredband2",img:"/img/testimonial/timmy.jpg",short:"Ehsan is a good influence and will contribute.

We worked together in the front-end team when I started at Bredband2, before I changed to backend. Ehsan is a good influence and will contribute. Since he is helpful, curious and kind, he will make an extra effort to participate and investigate an issue even if it is not his primary responsibility. His cheerful attitude is very valuable since he will uplift others, which in combination with his professional qualities makes him a really great and dedicated colleague. We shared many lunches, laughs and interesting conversations together. I definitely recommend Ehsan for these reasons!"},{id:3,name:"Fredrik Månsson",title:"System Developer at Bredband2",img:"/img/testimonial/fredrik.jpg",short:"He has a strong ability to quickly grasp the problems that need to be solved and utilize existing knowledge or gather new information to solve them.",desc:"During our time as colleagues at Bredband2, I have experienced Ehsan’s knowledge in programming and his desire to stay at the forefront of new technology. I have had the honor of working together with Ehsan in both large and small teams and projects. He has a strong ability to quickly grasp the problems that need solving and to use existing or acquire new knowledge to resolve them. We have had many great moments discussing programming and problem-solving, most recently in a project involving React and NextJS. In summary, I consider Ehsan to be a very skilled and motivated programmer. His technical expertise, commitment to self-improvement, and remarkable teamwork make him an indispensable member of any organization. I have no doubt that Ehsan will continue to make significant contributions and achieve great success in his future endeavors. I would not hesitate to have Ehsan as a colleague again in the future."},{id:2,name:"Erfan Shirazi",title:"CIO at Bredband2",img:"/img/testimonial/erfan.jpg",short:"He is incredibly competent, knowledgeable, and learns quickly.

He is incredibly competent, knowledgeable, and a fast learner. He was very well-liked by his colleagues and contributed a lot of valuable input regarding various aspects of web development and system development in general. I can highly recommend Ehsan for almost anything related to system development, both backend and frontend. If there’s ever something he doesn’t already know, he will learn it quickly.

I had the pleasure of working with Ehsan in my two interships at the Guts & Glory, we collaborated on many projects. I was particularly impressed by Ehsan´s ability to handle even the toughest projects effortlessly.
