<p>This got me to start thinking about some generative art; after some Googling I got to check out some R programming for drawing things, and after some lurking around Github I found some good examples written in go and python too. Got to install R and Processing 3 on my Mac. After trying to get the process working for a few hours, I was not lucky, and after some digging up I saw a lot of problems with the processor 3 and java versions. But v2 worked and i got my first images.
At this point I just want to make some pretty art and not do too much into learning the generative algorithms that are already in place.</p>`,s={title:"Generative Circles",date:"2019-03-28T13:39:40+00:00",status:"publish",permalink:"generative-circles",author:"Ehsan",type:"portfolio",id:381,agency:"FreeLance",category:["Lab"],tag:["CSS","HTML","Javascript","Maintenance","PHP","Web Development","Wordpress"],case_link_url:"https://github.com/ehsanpo/Many-Circles",client:"Carpings",tagline:"Generative Art!",background_image:"circle-8+10.png",logo:"circle-7.png",video:"",images:["circle-1.png","circle-2.png","circle-5.png","circle-6.png","circle-7.png","circle-8+10.png","circle-9.png","circle-10.png","circle-16.png","circle-17.png"],port_date:["2020"]},i="C:/Users/Ehsan/dev/astro-template/src/content/portfolio/generative-circles/circles.md",l=void 0;function y(){return`
