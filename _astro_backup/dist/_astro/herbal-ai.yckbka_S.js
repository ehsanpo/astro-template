# HerbalAI 🌿

An AI-powered herbal knowledge assistant built with Next.js, LangChain, and OpenAI. Discover the healing properties of medicinal herbs through intelligent conversation and comprehensive herb library browsing.

## Project Overview

HerbalAI represents my exploration into the intersection of artificial intelligence and traditional herbal medicine knowledge. This comprehensive web application enables users to discover, understand, and learn about medicinal herbs through an AI-powered interface that makes complex botanical knowledge accessible and engaging.

## The Challenge

Herbal medicine knowledge is vast and often scattered across traditional texts, scientific studies, and cultural practices. People seeking natural health solutions struggle to find reliable, comprehensive information about medicinal herbs. I set out to create a platform that would democratize access to herbal knowledge while leveraging modern AI capabilities for intelligent information retrieval.

## Key Features

### AI Chat Assistant

Interactive conversation about herbal medicine powered by OpenAI and LangChain. Users can ask nuanced questions about herbs and receive informed, context-aware responses based on a comprehensive knowledge base.

### Vector Search & Semantic Discovery

Intelligent retrieval of herbal information using embeddings and vector search. The system understands context and relationships between different herbs and their properties.

### Comprehensive Herb Library

Browse detailed information about medicinal herbs including scientific names, traditional uses, preparation methods, and safety precautions.

### Modern, Accessible Interface

Beautiful, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components, featuring dark/light theme support for comfortable viewing.

## Technical Implementation

### Modern Tech Stack

- **Next.js 13.5.1** with App Router for optimal performance
- **TypeScript** for type-safe development
- **LangChain** for sophisticated AI interactions
- **OpenAI API** for embeddings and chat completions
- **Tailwind CSS & Radix UI** for modern, accessible styling

### AI Architecture

- **Vector Store Creation**: Herbal data converted into embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding model
- **Semantic Search**: User questions embedded and matched against the herb knowledge base
- **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieved relevant herb information passed to GPT model for response generation
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Intelligent conversation that maintains context across interactions

### Data Architecture

Structured herbal database containing:

- Scientific names and botanical information
- Traditional and modern medicinal uses
- Preparation methods and dosage guidelines
- Safety precautions and contraindications
- Cultural and historical context

## Results & Impact

### Technical Achievements

- Successfully implemented RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline for accurate information retrieval
- Built scalable vector search system for semantic herb discovery
- Achieved excellent performance with optimized embedding storage and retrieval
- Created comprehensive herbal knowledge base with structured data

### User Experience

- Made complex herbal knowledge accessible through natural conversation
- Provided multiple discovery paths through chat and browsing interfaces
- Ensured safety-first approach with prominent medical disclaimers
- Created inclusive platform celebrating traditional and modern herbal wisdom

## Learning & Growth

This project significantly expanded my expertise in AI-powered information retrieval and RAG systems. Working with LangChain and OpenAI's embedding models taught me valuable lessons about semantic search, prompt engineering, and building AI applications that handle specialized domain knowledge effectively.

The challenge of organizing and presenting herbal information also deepened my understanding of information architecture for health-related content and the importance of responsible AI in medical domains.

## Future Development

The foundation supports several potential enhancements:

- Integration with scientific databases and research papers
- Personalized herb recommendations based on user preferences
- Community features for sharing traditional knowledge
