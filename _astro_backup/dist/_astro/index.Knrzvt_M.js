Lately, I’ve been using AI to speed up music production. Not to _compose_ music (yet 😅), but for all the little annoying stuff that normally eats hours.

Here’s my **modern workflow** for remixing a song:

---

## 1️⃣ Get Your Software

Grab your DAW or VSTs — I usually check [Professional Audio Software Blog](https://audioz.download/).
_Pro tip: support devs when you can!_

---

## 2️⃣ Find the Chords

- **[Chordify](https://chordify.net/)** → instant chord progressions. Saves tons of ear training time.

---

## 3️⃣ Extract Vocals

- **[Acapella-extractor.com](http://acapella-extractor.com/)** → free
- **[LALAL.AI](https://www.lalal.ai/)** → premium, AI-powered stem separation

Separate vocals, drums, bass, etc. Perfect for remixing!

---

## 4️⃣ Master Your Track

- **[Bakuage](https://bakuage.com/en/)**
- **[LANDR](https://www.landr.com/)**

No more guessing EQ and compression — AI analyzes and masters your track.

---

## 5️⃣ Visuals & Cover Art

- **[Butterchurn Visualizer](https://butterchurnviz.com/)** → mesmerizing audio-reactive visuals
- **[Kaleidosync](https://www.kaleidosync.com/visualizer)** → Spotify-connected
- **[WOMBO Dream](https://app.wombo.art/)** → AI-generated cover art (type a prompt, get instant art!)

Social media loves visuals — these tools make it effortless.

## ⚡ My Actual Workflow

1. Browse Spotify for inspiration
2. Extract vocals with LALAL.AI
3. Analyze chords with Chordify
4. Produce remix in DAW
5. Quick master with Bakuage
6. Make a visual with Butterchurn
7. Generate cover art with WOMBO
8. Upload to SoundCloud/Spotify

Boom — hours of work condensed into a day.

## 🔮 Why It Matters

AI tools remove boring technical barriers, letting bedroom producers compete with pros. You learn faster, iterate faster, and focus on the fun stuff — creativity.

The challenge now? Standing out. The ocean of content is massive.
