# Cover Image Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the cover image. The actual image should be named "cover.png" and placed in this directory.

Suggested image concept: A stylized illustration showing a mobile phone with a map interface displaying family member locations, with privacy/security elements like shield icons or lock symbols to emphasize the privacy-first approach.
