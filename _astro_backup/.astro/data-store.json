Previously, they relied on other online ordering websites provided by food delivery providers. To create a cohesive brand experience, a requirement gathering session was conducted in collaboration with a digital designer. The process began with the development of a new visual identity.

Conceptualizing Ljus Jakten:\u003C/h3>\n  \u003Cp>\n    Based on the client's goals, We developed the concept for Ljus Jakten, an HTML5 geo-based game. The game required players to explore the city, locate specific landmarks marked on a map, and collect three different symbols. This gameplay mechanic incentivized participants to visit multiple locations, effectively promoting Öresundskraft's brand and product.\n  \u003C/p>\n  \u003Ch3>3. Designing the Game Interface:\u003C/h3>\n  \u003Cp>\n    With a focus on user experience, I worked closely with a digital designer to designed an intuitive game interface that was visually appealing and easy to navigate. The interface included a map displaying the target locations, a symbol collection tracker, and clear instructions guiding players on how to participate and win.\n  \u003C/p>\n  \u003Ch3>4. Technical Implementation:\u003C/h3>\n  \u003Cp>\n    Using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, Google Maps, I developed Ljus Jakten as a web-based game. Leveraging geolocation services, I incorporated real-time tracking to ensure accurate location-based gameplay. Additionally, I integrated animations, sound effects, and responsive design elements to enhance the overall gaming experience across different devices.\n  \u003C/p>\n  \u003Ch3>5. Testing and Iteration:\u003C/h3>\n  \u003Cp>\n    To ensure a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience, rigorous testing was conducted on various devices and platforms. This iterative process involved gathering feedback from beta testers and addressing any bugs or performance issues identified. \n  \u003C/p>\n  \u003Ch3>6. Launch and Marketing Campaign:\u003C/h3>\n  \u003Cp>\n    Upon completion of development and testing, Ljus Jakten was launched as part of Öresundskraft's marketing campaign. The game was promoted through various marketing channels, including social media, website banners, and local advertising. Participants were encouraged to share their progress and experiences on social media platforms, generating buzz and further promoting Öresundskraft's brand.\n  \u003C/p>\n  \u003Ch3>7. Results and Impact:\u003C/h3>\n  \u003Cp>\n    Ljus Jakten proved to be a successful promotional tool for Öresundskraft. The game garnered significant engagement, attracting a wide range of participants eager to explore Ängelholm and collect the symbols. The interactive and immersive nature of the game effectively raised awareness of Öresundskraft's district heating plant and generated positive brand exposure within the target market.\n  \u003C/p>\n  \u003Ch3>Conclusion:\u003C/h3>\n  \u003Cp>\n    Ljus Jakten, an HTML5 geo-based game developed for Öresundskraft, proved to be an innovative and engaging marketing strategy. By combining interactive gameplay, location-based challenges, and captivating visuals, the game successfully promoted Öresundskraft's district heating plant in Ängelholm. The project highlights the power of gamification and creative digital solutions in driving brand awareness and customer engagement.\n  \u003C/p>",{"headings":1363,"localImagePaths":1364,"remoteImagePaths":1365,"frontmatter":1366,"imagePaths":1379},[],[],[],{"title":1339,"date":1340,"status":46,"permalink":1341,"author":47,"type":9,"id":1367,"agency":18,"category":1368,"tag":1369,"case_link_url":1346,"body_text":1370,"client":278,"tagline":40,"background_image":1371,"logo":1372,"video":1373,"images":1374,"port_date":1377,"side_image":1378},338,[20,109,110],[24,1344,229,69,70,632,110,1345],[40],"3.jpg","logo-1.png","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKgAt1hZeUg",[1375,1376,1024],"jj-1-Rotato-Snapshot.png","11.png",[96],[40],[],"ljusjakten/ljusjakten.md","loof-foundation/loof-foundation",{"id":1381,"data":1383,"body":1395,"filePath":1396,"assetImports":1397,"digest":1399,"rendered":1400,"legacyId":1412},{"title":1384,"description":1385,"tagline":1386,"date":1387,"permalink":1388,"client":1384,"agency":107,"category":1389,"tag":1390,"case_link_url":1392,"background_image":561,"logo":1393,"images":1394,"onHome":201},"Lööf Foundation","Designed and developed the front-end for the Lööf Foundation’s website, focusing on responsive design and user-friendly navigation.","A clean and responsive website for the Lööf Foundation.","2013","loof-foundation",[152,21],[1391,23,24,229,26],"Bootstrap 3","http://looffoundation.org","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./looflogo.jpg",[561],"\u003Ch2>Lööf Foundation: A Responsive Web Solution\u003C/h2>\n\n\u003Ch3>Introduction:\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\n  The Lööf Foundation needed a responsive and user-friendly website to communicate their mission and projects effectively.

Different actors.\n\nExcept React yells at you if you mutate state\nand PLCs yell at you by breaking real machines 🫠\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 State is just memory (stop overthinking it)\n\nIn PLC land:\n\n- You store flags\n- You latch bits\n- You remember what happened last cycle\n\nIn React:\n\n- `useState`\n- `useReducer`\n- `useRef` (aka \"pls don't re-render\" button)\n\nSame idea.\nDifferent syntax.\nMore memes.\n\nOnce I stopped treating React state like magic and started treating it like **PLC memory**, everything clicked.\n\nLike:\n\n- A button click = digital input\n- `setState` = coil energizing\n- Conditional rendering = contacts opening/closing\n\nI felt so smart for like 3 minutes 😂\n\n---\n\n## 🎮 Building an interactive story (because why not?)\n\nSo naturally, instead of just understanding this quietly like a normal person…\n\nI built a tiny interactive thing.\n\nAn app where:\n\n- Inputs toggle state\n- Logic decides what happens next\n- UI reacts visually\n\nBasically a **PLC simulator disguised as a React app**.\n\nWas it overkill?

Absolutely.\n\n---\n\n## 😵 My struggles (aka honesty time)\n\nLet's be real:\n\n- I broke stuff\n- I misunderstood hooks\n- I forgot dependencies in `useEffect` (don't judge me)\n- I re-rendered the universe by accident\n\nMultiple times.\n\nBut that's kinda the point, right?\nI'm just a curious dev smashing concepts together and seeing what survives 🔥\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Why this mindset helped me\n\nThinking in **automation logic** made React less scary.\n\nInstead of:\n\n> \"React is confusing\"\n\nIt became:\n\n> \"Oh, this is just reactive logic with prettier outputs\"\n\nAnd that mindset shift?\nGame changer.\n\nIf you come from:\n\n- PLCs\n- Arduino\n- Game dev\n- Even Excel formulas 😅\n\nYou already understand React more than you think.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Final thoughts (before I overthink this)\n\nIf you're learning React and feel stuck:\n\n- Build weird things\n- Compare it to stuff you already know\n- Don't wait to \"feel ready\"\n\nJust do it™️.\n\nWorst case?\nYou learn something.\nBest case?\nYou accidentally connect factories to frontends and feel like a wizard 🧙‍♂️✨\n\nAlright, I'll stop here before this turns into a book.\nThanks for reading, Now go break something and learn 💙","src/content/blog/from-automation-to-apps/index.md",[2969],"./cover.jpg","95ed8ad3ea3b2e93",{"html":2972,"metadata":2973},"\u003Cp>So… funny story.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A while ago I was playing with \u003Cstrong>PLCs\u003C/strong>.

I'm stuck at home. So naturally, I decided to build a VR app to teleport there. Spoiler: React 360 is dead, phone panoramas are imperfect, and I learned a lot.","2024-12-14",[26,3014],"VR",[3014,3016,3017,196,70,3018],"A-Frame","Three.js","Side Project","## The \"Why Did I Think This Would Be Easy?\" Moment\n\nMy brother Soroush went on this insane multi-month trip, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Thailand. While he was out there living his best life, he sent me these panorama photos from his phone like \"look at this mountain\" or \"check out this temple.\" And I'm sitting here in my apartment thinking... what if I could actually _be_ there?\n\nNot like, physically. But VR, right? Just throw on a headset and suddenly I'm standing in the same spot he was. How hard could it be?\n\n## The Idea That Started Everything\n\nSo here's the thing, I'm a self-taught developer. I've built websites, messed around with APIs, made a few apps that actually work. But VR? Never touched it. Still, I had this vision: take Soroush's phone panoramas, throw them into some kind of VR viewer, maybe later add some ambient sounds (imagine hearing the market noise in Vietnam or wind in the mountains), and boom, instant teleportation.\n\nI told Soroush to just take panoramas with his phone's built-in feature. Easy peasy. He did. I downloaded them. Looked at the files. 36 panorama JPEGs sitting in a folder on my desktop.\n\nNow what?\n\n## Down the React 360 Rabbit Hole (Oops)\n\nFirst instinct: Google \"how to make VR panorama viewer.\" Found React 360. Perfect! It's React, I know React, this'll be quick.\n\nStarted setting it up... and then realized React 360's GitHub repo had this fun little banner: **\"This repository has been archived by the owner on Dec 15, 2020.\"**\n\nDead. Deprecated. Abandoned.\n\n_Great start, Ehsan._\n\nI spent like an hour trying to make it work anyway (because why learn from other people's mistakes when you can make them yourself?). Dependencies broke. Nothing would run. The internet collectively shrugged at me.\n\n## Enter A-Frame (And Claude)\n\nThis is where I did what every modern developer does: I asked an AI for help. Specifically Claude Sonnet 4.5, because I'm not too proud to admit when I need a coding buddy who doesn't judge me.\n\n\"Hey Claude, React 360 is dead, what should I use instead?\"\n\n\"Try A-Frame.\"\n\nA-Frame turned out to be _perfect_. It's a web framework for VR built on top of Three.js, actively maintained, has actual documentation. Within like 30 minutes I had a basic HTML file running with my first panorama loaded. Saw Soroush's mountain photo wrapped around me in 360°.\n\nI literally said \"YES!\" out loud to my empty apartment.\n\n## Then Reality Hit: Quality & Cuts\n\nHere's where things got messy.\n\n**Problem 1: The image quality was... not good.** Like, really not good. Blurry, washed out, looked like I was viewing everything through dirty glasses. I thought maybe my code was wrong? Nope. Turns out:\n\n- Phone panoramas are compressed JPEGs (to save space)\n- A-Frame was doing additional texture downsampling\n- Color space stuff was making everything look washed out and shiny\n\nI spent _hours_ tweaking texture settings. LinearFilter vs NearestFilter. Anisotropic filtering. MipMaps. sRGB encoding vs Linear encoding. Felt like I was playing with magic spells I didn't understand.\n\nClaude helped me push the quality settings to the max, 8K canvas resolution, maximum anisotropic filtering, high-precision shaders. It got better, but still not perfect. Because ultimately, you can't magically enhance source image quality.\n\n**Problem 2: The seam.** Phone panoramas aren't true 360° spherical images. They're wide horizontal strips. And because of how Soroush took them (just moving his phone in an arc), some had this weird _cut_ in the middle where the image doesn't perfectly loop.\n\nI tried using a cylinder instead of a sphere. Worse.\n\nI tried different texture wrapping modes. Helped a bit, but the seam was still there.\n\nI adjusted rotation angles. Made it less noticeable but never fully gone.\n\nEventually I had to accept: phone panoramas just have limitations. They're not shot on a fancy 360° camera. They're good enough, not perfect.\n\n## What Actually Worked\n\nAfter all the struggling, here's what I ended up with:\n\n- **A-Frame** for the VR framework (way better than React 360)\n- **Simple HTML + JavaScript**, no fancy build process, just one file\n- **Manual texture loading** with Three.js to control quality settings\n- **Previous/Next buttons** to switch between panoramas\n- **Keyboard controls** (arrow keys) because why not\n- **High-quality texture settings** pushed as far as my GPU allows\n- **Accept the imperfections**, the seam exists, quality is limited, and that's okay\n\nThe whole thing runs in a browser. No installs, no VR headset required (though it works with one if you have it). Just open `index.html` and you're teleported.\n\n## Lessons I Didn't Expect to Learn\n\n1. **Dead tech is everywhere.** React 360 looked perfect in search results, but it's been dead for 5 years. Always check if a project is maintained before diving in.\n\n2. **Phone panoramas ≠ VR panoramas.** They're different formats. Phone panoramas are convenient but not designed for spherical projection. If I want perfect VR, I'd need proper 360° camera footage.\n\n3. **Image quality is hard.** You can't just \"enhance\" low-res compressed JPEGs. Texture filtering, color spaces, GPU capabilities — there's a whole world of graphics programming I barely scratched the surface of.\n\n4. **AI coding assistants are actually helpful.** Claude didn't write all my code, but it helped me debug, suggested alternatives when I hit dead ends, and explained concepts I didn't know. It's like pair programming with someone patient.\n\n5. **Shipping something imperfect is better than not shipping.** The seam bugs me. The quality isn't pristine. But it _works_. I can click through Soroush's trip and see what he saw. That's the whole point.\n\n## If You're Trying Something Similar\n\nListen, if you're reading this and thinking \"I want to try building something with VR\" or \"I want to experiment with something I've never done before,\" here's my advice:\n\n**Just start.** Even if you don't know what you're doing. Even if your first choice is wrong (RIP React 360). Even if your images look kinda bad and there's a weird seam.\n\n**Ask for help.** Use AI, Google, Stack Overflow, whatever. No one expects you to know everything. I sure didn't.\n\n**Accept imperfection.** Your first version won't be perfect. It might not even be _good_. But it'll be _done_, and that's infinitely better than a perfect project that only exists in your head.\n\n**Iterate later.** Right now, ChillInVR loads panoramas and lets you look around. Cool. Later, I want to add ambient sounds — maybe AI-generated audio based on the location. Then maybe add info overlays, or clickable hotspots. But I shipped the basic version _first_.\n\n## What's Next\n\nI'm gonna keep adding to this. Ambient sounds are next, imagine hearing market chatter in Vietnam or wind in the mountains. Maybe some subtle background music. Maybe let users upload their own panoramas.\n\nBut for now? It works. I can put on a headset (or just use my browser) and stand where Soroush stood. That's pretty cool.\n\nIf you've ever tried building something outside your comfort zone, or if you're thinking about it, I'd love to hear your story. What'd you build? What went wrong? What surprised you?\n\nIt's messy out here.

Like, **generative art** but for my eyeballs instead of my ears.\n\nSo I did what any normal person would do: opened ten browser tabs, fell into a GitHub hole, and discovered people making wild generative visuals in **R**, **Go**, and **Python**.\n\nAnd wow. The stuff people do with just a few lines of code is _ridiculous_.\n\n---\n\n## Setting Things Up (a.k.a. The Java Saga)\n\nNaturally, I decided to try it myself. Installed **R**. Then installed **Processing 3** on my Mac.\nAnd… yeah, that was a disaster. 🙃\n\nProcessing 3 and Java apparently have beef, because nothing worked. After a few hours of debugging (and a small existential crisis), I rolled back to **Processing v2** and — hallelujah! — it worked.\n\nCircles appeared! Pretty ones!\n\nHonestly, at that point, I didn’t even care _how_ it worked. I just wanted to make cool visuals and pretend I was an algorithmic artist.\n\n---\n\n## The Results (woohoo! 🎉)\n\nHere’s a few of the patterns I made:\n\n![Circular generative art with overlapping patterns](./circle-8+10.png)\n_Complex overlapping circles that look like they’re plotting something_\n\n![Simple circular pattern](./circle-1.png)\n_Minimalist and chill_\n\n![Geometric circular design](./circle-2.png)\n_Geometric perfection vibes_\n\n![Organic circular pattern](./circle-5.png)\n_Kinda flowy, kinda alive_\n\n![Dense circular pattern](./circle-6.png)\n_Dense and slightly overwhelming (like my brain on coffee)_\n\n![Radiating circles](./circle-7.png)\n_Sunburst-y and dramatic_\n\n![Nested circles](./circle-8.png)\n_Like circles inside circles inside circles..._\n\n![Dynamic circular composition](./circle-9.png)\n_Looks like it might start spinning if I stare too long_\n\n---\n\n## What I Learned (aka why circles are secretly deep)\n\n### 💡 The Beauty of Algorithms\n\nEven though it was all circles, every image turned out _so different_.\nLike:\n\n- **Precise math** vs. **random chaos**\n- **Dense complexity** vs. **clean minimalism**\n- **Overlapping madness** vs. **perfect geometry**\n\nIt’s wild how much personality a few lines of code can have.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Processing vs. R\n\nSo I played around with both:\n\n- **Processing** → felt way more natural for visuals. You draw, you tweak, you see results instantly.\n- **R** → more technical but sooo good if you want mathematical control.\n- Both communities are super active and helpful (thank you, random forum strangers 🙏).\n\n---\n\n### 🎨 Creativity Through Constraints\n\nHere’s the funny thing — when I limited myself to **just circles**, I got _way_ more creative. Like, weirdly so.\n\nBy only tweaking stuff like:\n\n- size\n- opacity\n- color gradients\n- how they overlap or intersect\n- little position algorithms\n\n…I ended up with endless variations. Turns out “less is more” actually works sometimes (who knew?).\n\n---\n\n## My Tech Setup (for the curious nerds 👩‍💻)\n\n**What worked:**\n\n- Processing 2 (don’t ask me about v3 😩)\n- Basic geometry functions\n- Simple random() stuff\n- Layer blending (chef’s kiss)\n\n**My super scientific process:**\n\n1. Draw a circle.\n2. Randomize everything.\n3. Go “hmm, interesting.”\n4. Add color + opacity.\n5. Layer it a bunch until it looks artsy.\n6. Screenshot it before it breaks.\n\n---\n\n## Why I Love Generative Art 💖\n\nIt’s that **element of surprise**. You give the computer rules, and it goes, “cool, but what if I did this instead?”\n\nYou’re not _making_ the art — you’re _collaborating_ with the algorithm. It’s half you, half the machine, and 100% unexpected.\n\nEvery image feels both planned and chaotic at the same time. Like art with a mind of its own.\n\n---\n\nSo yeah — what started as a music experiment turned into me falling in love with algorithmic circles.\n\nWho needs perfection when you have randomness, right? 😉\n\n_(P.S.

Classic.\n\n---\n\n## The Idea (aka: what was I thinking?)\n\nI didn't want a skills test.\nNo quizzes like _\"what does this JavaScript output?\"_ (trauma 😭).\n\nI wanted something more **psychological**.\nSomething that feels like real dev life.\n\nEvery question forces a trade-off:\n\n- ship fast vs build it right\n- explore vs maintain\n- solo grinding vs team collaboration\n\nYour answers slowly pull you toward one of **12 developer archetypes** like:\n\n- **The Ship It** 🚀\n- **The Detective** 🕵️\n- **The Craftsman** 🛠️\n- (yes, Architecture Astronaut is there too 👀)\n\nNo \"right\" answers. Just vibes.\n\n## 💡 Inspiration\n\nThis assessment was inspired by the article [The 12 Developer Mindsets I've Seen in My Career](https://dev.to/notadevbuthere/the-12-developer-mindsets-ive-seen-in-my-career-and-what-they-teach-us-about-building-software-42de) by [@notadevbuthere](https://dev.to/notadevbuthere). The archetypes and core concepts are based on real developer behaviors and patterns observed in software teams.\n\n---\n\n## The Stack (kept it simple, promise)\n\nI didn't want backend drama. No auth. No DB. No servers.\nJust frontend fun.\n\n- **React + Vite** – fast, clean, no pain\n- **React Router** – with `HashRouter` because GitHub Pages 😅\n- **Pure CSS** – no Tailwind, no frameworks, just vibes and CSS variables\n- **html2canvas** – for downloading results as images (this was surprisingly fun)\n\nThat's it. No magic. No enterprise nonsense.\n\n---\n\n## Cool Stuff I'm Proud Of ✨\n\n### 🧠 Smart-ish Scoring\n\nEach answer gives **weighted points** to multiple archetypes.\n\nSo you're not just \"one thing\".\nThe algorithm can notice stuff like:\n\n> \"huh, this person scores high in _Ship It_ AND _Craftsman_… interesting tension 👀\"\n\nIt actually felt like teaching the app to understand personalities. Kinda creepy. Kinda cool.\n\n---\n\n### 🔗 Shareable Results & Download\n\nResults are encoded into the URL using base64.\nNo backend needed – just pure frontend magic ✨\n\nWhich means:\n\n- share the link and anyone can see your result\n- no retaking the test\n- no database, no servers, my wallet is happy\n- download your result as a PNG\n- share directly to LinkedIn (yes, devs love this stuff)\n\nEncoding state into the URL turned out to be insanely powerful. Sharing just works™ and I wanted it to feel like an **achievement unlock** 🎖️, not just text on a screen.\n\n---\n\n## The Questions (harder than coding tbh)\n\n20 questions.\n4 answers each.\n\nThis part took the longest.\n\nEach answer had to:\n\n- feel _real_\n- map clearly to personality traits\n- not scream \"THIS IS THE CORRECT ANSWER\" 🙃\n\nExample question:\n\n> **You find a messy file that somehow works.

Big companies like Google and Microsoft are everywhere with it, and I’ve played with Google Vision for fun. But making my own ML stuff? That felt scary.\n\nI work as a **full-stack developer** at [Guts & Glory](http://gutsglory.se/) in Sweden — mostly building WordPress sites from designs. I’m not a hardcore programmer, but I love GitHub. If there’s a repo with a solid README, I can usually clone it, run it, and tweak things until it works.\n\n---\n\n## The Crazy Idea 💡\n\nEveryone talks about AI taking over jobs… so I thought: _maybe I can build the AI that takes over mine!_\n\nStep 1: AI looks at a design → slices it into sections → detects elements (text, images, colors, spacing) → uses pre-written HTML/CSS to build a WordPress site.\n\nStep 2: Realize that’s waaaay too ambitious for a first ML project 😅\n\nSo I needed a side project to **train on something simpler**. Inspiration hit while watching _Silicon Valley_ — the “hotdog or not” AI. My brain immediately went:\n\n> “I’ll build an AI that rates how hot faces are! Don’t judge me!”\n\n---\n\n## Finding the Code 🐍\n\nI found some Python/TensorFlow/OpenCV repos:\n\n- [Hotdog Classification](https://github.com/hayzamjs/Hotdog-Classification)\n- [Guide on TensorFlow Hotdogs](https://aboveintelligent.com/using-tensorflow-to-classify-hotdogs-8494fb85d875)\n\nProblem: I don’t know Python 😅. Spent ~2 hours fixing versions and missing models. Finally got it running!\n\n---\n\n## Gathering Data 🖼️\n\nFirst attempt: Google image search for “pretty girls” vs. “ugly girls” and download with **Fatkun Batch**.\n\nProblem: I only want **faces**, not the whole picture.\n\nSolution: Use a face-cropping script:\n\n- [Face Cropping GitHub](https://github.com/icchi-h/face-cropping)\n\nAfter cleaning up wrong detections, I had ~1,000 “pretty” and ~400 “ugly” faces.\n\n---\n\n## Training & Testing 🏋️\n\nAfter training, I tested:\n\n- **Kate Upton** → hot 0.96 ✅\n- **Rihanna** → hot 0.99 ✅\n- **Miley Cyrus** → hot 0.72 🤷‍♂️\n- **Hillary Clinton** → hot 0.40 😅\n- **My own face** → hot 0.52 😎\n\nNot perfect, but honestly, I’m kinda impressed for a first try.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons Learned 💡\n\n1. GitHub + good READMEs = life saver\n2. Python + TensorFlow + OpenCV version hell is real\n3. Data quality matters — garbage in, garbage out\n4. Start small, test a lot, embrace happy accidents\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI’d love feedback from other devs and eventually try my **dream project**: AI that turns a wireframe/design into a WordPress site automatically.\n\n---\n\n## Just Do It! 🚀\n\nIf you want to learn AI or coding: you can. Copy code, run it, tweak it, break it, learn. Patience is everything. If I can do it, you can too.\n\n_P.S.

For me, and apparently a lot of other devs, that thing is `useState` in React. I mean, it's the first hook you learn, right? It's so easy! You're just like, `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`, and boom, you have state. Woohoo!\n\nBut then I watched this insane talk by David Khourshid at React Miami, called \"Goodbye, useState,\" and my mind was totally blown. Seriously, I went in thinking, \"This guy is probably gonna tell me to stop using my favorite hook,\" and he pretty much did. But in a cool, \"hey, let's learn something new\" kind of way.\n\n_The spaghetti diagram David showed that blew my mind_\n\n## The useState Problem\n\nHe basically said that `useState` is great for simple stuff, but for anything even a little bit complex, it's a \"foot gun.\" He showed this crazy diagram of how `useState` and `useEffect` can get all tangled up, like a bowl of spaghetti. It becomes this mess where one thing changes, and it triggers a chain reaction of re-renders, and you're just like, \"What even is happening?!\" It's a nightmare to debug, and I've definitely been there, pulling my hair out trying to figure out why my component is re-rendering for the fifth time.\n\n## The Better Alternatives\n\nSo, what's a self-taught dev to do? David had some amazing suggestions that I'm totally going to try.\n\n### 1. Don't need a re-render? Use useRef!\n\nThis was such a \"duh\" moment for me. If I have some data I need to keep track of that doesn't affect the UI, like a click counter that just logs to the console, I can just use `useRef` instead of `useState`. It's like a secret hiding spot for my data, and React doesn't even know about it. So smart!\n\n```javascript\n// Instead of this useState mess...\nconst [clickCount, setClickCount] = useState(0);\n\nconst handleClick = () => {\n\tsetClickCount((prev) => prev + 1);\n\tconsole.log(clickCount); // Still shows old value!\n};\n\n// Use useRef for non-UI state!\nconst clickCountRef = useRef(0);\n\nconst handleClick = () => {\n\tclickCountRef.current += 1;\n\tconsole.log(clickCountRef.current); // Always current!\n};\n```\n\n### 2. Put state in the URL\n\nOkay, this is so cool. I never thought about it, but you can actually put your filters or sorting preferences right in the URL. That way, if you refresh the page or send the link to a friend, all your settings are saved. No more getting frustrated when I lose my progress. It's so simple, yet so powerful.\n\n```javascript\n// Instead of useState for filters...\nconst [filter, setFilter] = useState(\"all\");\n\n// Use URL search params!\nconst searchParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);\nconst filter = searchParams.get(\"filter\") || \"all\";\n```\n\n### 3. Stop using useState for forms and fetching\n\nI'm so guilty of this. I've been creating a `useState` for every single input on my forms, and then another one for `isLoading`, and `error`, and `data`... it's a mess! David said we should just use native browser APIs for forms and libraries like TanStack Query for data fetching. I'm all about using the right tool for the job, and if a library can handle all that messy stuff better than I can, I'm totally on board.\n\n_Old way vs. new way of handling forms_\n\n```javascript\n// Instead of this useState nightmare...\nconst [name, setName] = useState(\"\");\nconst [email, setEmail] = useState(\"\");\nconst [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\nconst [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n// Use FormData and proper form handling!\nconst handleSubmit = (event) => {\n\tevent.preventDefault();\n\tconst formData = new FormData(event.target);\n\tconst name = formData.get(\"name\");\n\tconst email = formData.get(\"email\");\n\t// Much cleaner!\n};\n```\n\n### 4. Use useReducer for complex stuff\n\nThis one scares me a little, I'm not gonna lie. It seems way more complicated than `useState`. But David made a good point: when your logic is complex, like for a shopping cart, `useReducer` is better. It gives you a clear log of what's happening and makes your code more organized. I'm a little nervous to try it, but I'm a big believer in \"just do it,\" so I'm gonna give it a shot.\n\n```javascript\n// Instead of multiple useState calls...\nconst [items, setItems] = useState([]);\nconst [total, setTotal] = useState(0);\nconst [discount, setDiscount] = useState(0);\n\n// Use useReducer for related state!\nconst [cart, dispatch] = useReducer(cartReducer, initialCart);\n\nconst addItem = (item) => dispatch({ type: \"ADD_ITEM\", payload: item });\nconst removeItem = (id) => dispatch({ type: \"REMOVE_ITEM\", payload: id });\n```\n\n## The Philosophy Shift\n\nThe whole talk really made me rethink how I approach state in React. It's easy to just stick with what you know, but as a self-taught dev who loves to tinker and experiment, I know that's not how you grow. The final takeaway from the talk was that **simple is better than easy**. And that's a philosophy I can totally get behind.\n\n`useState` is _easy_ - you can slap it anywhere and it works. But these alternatives are _simple_ - they solve the right problem with the right tool, making your code cleaner and more maintainable in the long run.\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to rewrite some of my GitHub projects. My code needs a serious glow-up after this talk!\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n- ✅ Replace unnecessary `useState` with `useRef` for non-UI state\n- ✅ Move filter/search state to URL parameters\n- ✅ Try TanStack Query for data fetching\n- ⏳ Learn `useReducer` for complex state logic\n\nAnyone else had a similar \"aha moment\" with React hooks? I'd love to hear about your experiences breaking up with old patterns and embracing better alternatives!\n\n---\n\n_P.S. - If you haven't watched David Khourshid's \"Goodbye, useState\" talk, do yourself a favor and check it out.

But yeah… that’s how it started. I’ve always had an eye for design, so messing around with graphics, covers, and layouts was my playground.\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 From Photoshop to HTML/CSS\n\nNaturally, design pushed me toward the web. HTML and CSS became my jam (and my nightmare). Aligning stuff was like dark magic back then. Tables for layout? Floats everywhere? And don’t get me started on IE6… 🥲\n\nBut I loved the creative part — making something look good, making sure it _felt_ right.

But hey, it was magic at the time.\n\n---\n\n## 🧱 PHP + WordPress World\n\nAfter that, I leveled up into PHP. WordPress became my playground. Building themes, customizing plugins, breaking sites and fixing them again — I learned a ton.

Still, PHP gave me my first taste of _real development_.\n\n---\n\n## 🤝 Hacking with the Facebook API\n\nSomewhere in this mix, I got into making **Facebook apps** (back when that was the cool thing). Using the API, I hacked together little apps that pulled profiles, posted to walls, and generally made me feel like a genius. It was messy, but so fun.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ The Node.js Awakening\n\nThen came **Node.js**, and my brain basically exploded. Writing JavaScript on the server?? Building APIs?? Deploying on AWS (and immediately regretting the bill)? Total game-changer.\n\nThat’s when I went from “frontend guy who dabbles in backend” → full-blown fullstack dev life. Suddenly I was juggling React, Express, databases, deployments, UX, performance, security, everything. Chaos, but the good kind.\n\n```javascript\n// baby steps\n$(\"#menu\").slideToggle();\n\n// fast forward → fullstack chaos\napp.use(\"/api\", authMiddleware, apiRoutes);\napp.use(\"/\", serveStaticFiles);\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 The Struggles (and Lessons)\n\n- **Design & UX**: Making things pretty is easy, making them _usable_ is harder.\n- **State Management**: React and Redux both made me cry.\n- **Performance**: Optimizing both ends of the stack felt like whack-a-mole.\n- **Security**: Realizing my early login systems were wide open 🤦.\n- **Scalability**: 10 users fine, 1000 users = 🔥.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Tools That Changed Everything\n\n- **Photoshop 7**: Where it all began 🖼️\n- **jQuery**: The OG magic wand ✨\n- **WordPress**: My messy but lovable training ground\n- **Git**: Saved me from “final_final_reallyfinal.zip” hell\n- **TypeScript**: I fought it, then fell in love\n- **Tailwind CSS**: Bye-bye CSS class naming wars\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Looking Back\n\nIt’s wild to think about the path: from slicing images in Photoshop to animating menus with jQuery → hacking WordPress themes → building Facebook apps → running Node.js APIs → and now, doing fullstack dev like it’s normal.\n\nIt’s been messy, funny, frustrating, and ridiculously rewarding. And honestly? I wouldn’t change a thing.\n\nThe journey never ends — you just keep leveling up, trying new tools, and asking the same old question:\n👉 _“Can your mom navigate this app?”_ 😅","src/content/blog/my-fullstack-developer-journey/index.md",[3257],"0e05e214f5f8bad7",{"html":3510,"metadata":3511},"\u003Cp>If you told younger-me — the kid spending hours in \u003Cstrong>Photoshop 7\u003C/strong>, carefully slicing images for rounded corners (lol, before border-radius was a thing) — that one day I’d be writing APIs and scaling apps, I would’ve laughed and gone back to designing fake CD covers.

It was one of those \"you don't really need this but here's a cool trick\" things, kinda like discovering `console.table` in the browser console (mind = blown).\n\nBut also… confusing af. Like, do I memoize everything? Nothing? My grocery list? 🛒\n\n```javascript\n// Me, circa 2022, memoizing EVERYTHING\nconst expensiveCalculation = useMemo(() => {\n\treturn 2 + 2; // Very expensive math, clearly\n}, []);\n\nconst memoizedString = useMemo(() => {\n\treturn \"hello world\"; // Such optimization, wow\n}, []);\n```\n\nThen `useCallback` came along and I was like, \"okay now I'm just wrapping functions for no reason.\" Half the time it fixed nothing, but hey, at least my code _looked_ professional 😂\n\nFast-forward a bit → I got into the habit: _oh, function as a prop? slap a `useCallback` on it!_ Expensive calculation? `useMemo` it! Woohoo optimization nation!\n\n```javascript\n// My old code be like:\nconst handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n\tconsole.log(\"clicked\"); // Very callback, much memo\n}, []);\n\nconst handleSubmit = useCallback(\n\t(data) => {\n\t\tsubmitForm(data); // Definitely needed this wrapper\n\t},\n\t[submitForm]\n);\n```\n\n---\n\n## Enter React 19 rumors 👀\n\nNow, this comment says React 19 is making these hooks basically **useless.** Like… not deprecated, but redundant. The React team is apparently cooking some next-level optimizations, so a lot of manual memoization might just disappear.\n\nThink: React gets smarter → you get lazier → code gets cleaner.\n(yes please 🙏)\n\nI mean, frameworks like SolidJS and Svelte already flex with this whole \"fine-grained reactivity\" thing, where the UI updates only the stuff that changes. If React adopts something similar, why would I waste brain cells wrapping everything in `useMemo`?\n\n### What this might look like:\n\n```javascript\n// Current React: Manual optimization everywhere\nconst MyComponent = ({ items, filter }) => {\n\tconst filteredItems = useMemo(() => {\n\t\treturn items.filter((item) => item.category === filter);\n\t}, [items, filter]);\n\n\tconst handleItemClick = useCallback(\n\t\t(id) => {\n\t\t\tonItemClick(id);\n\t\t},\n\t\t[onItemClick]\n\t);\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t\u003Cdiv>\n\t\t\t{filteredItems.map((item) => (\n\t\t\t\t\u003CItem key={item.id} onClick={handleItemClick} />\n\t\t\t))}\n\t\t\u003C/div>\n\t);\n};\n\n// React 19 (maybe?): Just write normal code\nconst MyComponent = ({ items, filter }) => {\n\tconst filteredItems = items.filter((item) => item.category === filter);\n\n\tconst handleItemClick = (id) => {\n\t\tonItemClick(id);\n\t};\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t\u003Cdiv>\n\t\t\t{filteredItems.map((item) => (\n\t\t\t\t\u003CItem key={item.id} onClick={handleItemClick} />\n\t\t\t))}\n\t\t\u003C/div>\n\t);\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n## But will it really happen?\n\nHere's the thing… React is like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Big, messy, tons of fans, lots of backwards compatibility baggage. They can't just snap their fingers like Thanos and say _\"lol no more `useMemo`\"_.\n\nSo yeah, maybe in React 19 these hooks won't be _as necessary_, but I doubt they'll vanish overnight. They'll probably still hang around for:\n\n- Old projects that need migration\n- Library authors who need fine-grained control\n- Paranoid devs (hi, that's me 👋)\n- Edge cases where manual optimization is still needed\n\nAlso, ngl, sometimes memoization is just placebo. I've legit wrapped tiny functions in `useCallback` thinking I'm saving the world, when in reality React's like: _\"bro… that did nothing.\"_ 😂\n\n### The reality check:\n\nMost of the time, our components aren't actually slow because of missing memoization. They're slow because of:\n\n- Massive component trees\n- Too many re-renders from state changes\n- Heavy computations that shouldn't be in render functions anyway\n- Poor data structures\n\n---\n\n## What the experts are saying\n\nThe React team has hinted at some wild stuff coming:\n\n- **Automatic memoization**: React might just figure out what to memoize on its own\n- **Better scheduling**: Smarter about when and how to update components\n- **Compile-time optimizations**: Your build tool might optimize React code before it hits the browser\n\nDan Abramov tweeted something like _\"stop premature optimization\"_ (paraphrasing), and honestly, maybe he's right. Maybe we've been overthinking this whole time.\n\n---\n\n## My takeaway (aka me pep-talking myself)\n\nHonestly, I'm kinda excited about this future. Because if React 19 really makes `useMemo` and `useCallback` useless, that means **less boilerplate, fewer bugs, and one less thing for beginners (like me!) to overthink.**\n\nAnd that's a win.\n\n### My new strategy:\n\n1. **Write clean, readable code first**\n2. **Profile and measure actual performance issues**\n3. **Optimize only when there's a real problem**\n4. **Trust React to get smarter over time**\n\nSo yeah… maybe one day we'll look back and laugh at our old code sprinkled with `useMemo` like confetti. Until then, I'll keep slapping them in my code whenever I panic about performance. Don't judge me.\n\n```javascript\n// Future me looking at 2024 code:\nconst needlessOptimization = useMemo(() => {\n\treturn \"Why did I wrap a string in useMemo? 🤦‍♂️\";\n}, []);\n```\n\n---\n\n## The bottom line\n\nReact 19 might make our manual optimizations obsolete, but that's actually **amazing news**. It means we can focus on building great user experiences instead of micro-managing every render cycle.\n\nPlus, if React gets this right, it'll make the framework more approachable for everyone. No more \"should I useMemo this?\" anxiety. No more cargo-cult programming with useCallback.\n\nJust clean, fast React code that works.\n\n_Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go remove 47 unnecessary `useCallback`s from my current project... 😅_\n\n---\n\n**What do you think?

Everyone in dev land keeps saying: _“We work Agile. We do sprints. We build MVPs first. Nice-to-haves later.”_\n\nBut the second you start coding with AI? That whole system feels… off.\n\n---\n\n## Agile vs. AI Speedrun\n\nAgile was made for a world where coding was slow, expensive, and full of risk. You break things into stories, you prioritize, you sprint, you iterate. It makes sense… if typing code is the hard part.\n\nBut with AI, typing isn’t the bottleneck anymore. Thinking is.\n\nThe AI doesn’t care what’s “MVP” or what’s “nice-to-have.” It’ll happily generate both in the same session. Sometimes I just ask for a basic version, and it still goes “oh btw, here’s a dashboard, an auth flow, and five utility functions you didn’t ask for.” Thanks? I guess? 😂\n\nSo instead of carefully adding things sprint by sprint, you kinda… teleport to the end state. And then throw half of it away because you realize you didn’t actually need all that. That’s why Agile feels weird with AI — the cycles are _too fast_.\n\n---\n\n## Building From Scratch With AI\n\nWhen I start a new project now, I don’t think like an Agile dev. I think like:\n\n1. **Can AI generate me an overall plan?**\n2. **Can it break that plan into pieces?**\n3. **Which parts do I actually care about, and which can I let the AI cook?**\n\nIt’s not about backlog grooming anymore. It’s more like blueprinting with a co-pilot who over-delivers.\n\nAnd honestly, that shift has been huge for me. It’s like pair programming with a super eager junior dev who codes 100x faster but sometimes invents random imports. You gotta guide it, babysit it a bit… but the speed is unreal.\n\n---\n\n## Refactoring With AI\n\nAnother weird thing: refactoring doesn’t happen at the “later” stage anymore. With Agile, you ship now and clean later. With AI, I’ll generate a messy version and _immediately_ ask it to refactor, add tests, or even port it into a different stack.\n\nSo instead of carrying “technical debt,” I carry “prompt debt.” The more I refine my instructions, the cleaner the code gets — without me manually rewriting thousands of lines. That part feels totally alien compared to how I used to work.\n\n---\n\n## My Portfolio Story 🎨\n\nWhen I built my portfolio site recently, I leaned fully into this workflow.\n\n- First, I had AI create an **overall plan**. Then I asked it to break that down into smaller specs. Boom — I had a roadmap without touching Jira.\n- Next, I got AI to help me build a **design system**: colors, components, typography, the whole vibe.\n- Then I converted that into a **Next.js site**.\n- Added my own content (the only boring manual part, lol).\n- And finally… just let the AI cook. 👨‍🍳✨\n\nThe result? A working site full of small bugs, lots of \"any\" types, messed up margins and colors not following the system design. Without me changing the code its not usable.\n\n---\n\n## So What’s The Deal?\n\nFor me, Agile with AI feels like forcing an old rhythm on a new instrument. The methodology was built for scarcity — AI dev is built for abundance. You don’t sprint anymore, you _speedrun_.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Agile is dead — it’s still great for teams, communication, structure.

You break things into stories, you prioritize, you sprint, you iterate. It makes sense… if typing code is the hard part.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But with AI, typing isn’t the bottleneck anymore. Thinking is.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The AI doesn’t care what’s “MVP” or what’s “nice-to-have.” It’ll happily generate both in the same session. Sometimes I just ask for a basic version, and it still goes “oh btw, here’s a dashboard, an auth flow, and five utility functions you didn’t ask for.” Thanks? I guess? 😂\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So instead of carefully adding things sprint by sprint, you kinda… teleport to the end state. And then throw half of it away because you realize you didn’t actually need all that.

It’s more like blueprinting with a co-pilot who over-delivers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And honestly, that shift has been huge for me. It’s like pair programming with a super eager junior dev who codes 100x faster but sometimes invents random imports.

One thing that kept biting me was **excess property checks**, plus the difference between `object`, `{}`, `Object` types. I want to share what I learned, because earlier I was confused, maybe you will too, and maybe this helps you avoid stepping on the same banana peel 🍌.\n\n---\n\n### What even _are_ excess property checks?\n\nSo imagine I define:\n\n```ts\ntype Person = { firstName: string; age: number };\n\nfunction logPerson(person: Person) {\n\tconsole.log(person);\n}\n```\n\nThen I try\n\n```ts\nconst person2: Person = { firstName: \"potato\", age: 21, extraProp: \"hello!\" }; // \u003C-- error\n```\n\nAt first I was like “wtf, I thought TypeScript was structural, isn’t extraProp ok if it has all the required ones?” But no — TS is stricter when you assign an _object literal_ directly to a typed variable (or pass literal directly to a function). It checks: “does this literal have any properties I don’t know about (i.e. not in the target type)?” If yes → error. That’s the “excess property check.” ([TypeScript][1])\n\nBut then, I did this:\n\n```ts\nconst person3: Person = {\n\tfirstName: \"potato\",\n\tage: 21,\n\t...{ extraProp: \"hello!\" },\n}; // fine\n```\n\nAND it passed. And I was like “omg why?” 🤔 Turns out: because of how TS handles spreads and variables/inference. If you spread in extra props, or assign literal to a variable first, TS doesn’t always trigger that excess prop check. The literal isn’t “fresh” in a sense, so TS is more forgiving. ([allthingstypescript.dev][2])\n\n---\n\n### Why this behavior exists (and my struggle)\n\n- It’s super helpful for catching little mistakes: typos, misspelling property names, etc. For example, you meant `color` but typed `colour`, TS might warn. ([TypeScript][1])\n- But the inconsistency annoyed me. I kept wondering: “why does doing `.push(...)` in one case break, but in another, no?” Or “why does spreading let me sneak extra props in?”\n- Eventually I saw: TS is structural (duck typing), but it gives special treatment to object _literals_ when creating or assigning them.

(Yes, I tested this.) ([Type-Level TypeScript][4])\n\n---\n\n### That “array union” snippet & mutation weirdness\n\nYou also gave the snippet:\n\n```ts\nconst foo: string[] = [\"1\", \"2\"];\n\nfunction bar(things: (number | string)[]) {\n\tthings.push(3); // passes type check\n}\nbar(foo);\n```\n\nI remember doing similar stupid stuff. What’s going on:\n\n- `foo` is `string[]`\n- `bar` wants `(number|string)[]`\n- Because every `string` is acceptable where `(number|string)` is expected, `string[]` is assignable to `(string|number)[]`. (Covariance in this context)\n- So TS lets you call `bar(foo)`. Then inside `bar`, pushing `3` (a number) is allowed because the type of `things` is `(string|number)[]`. So at runtime, you end up with a mix. Type safety is “ok” by TS’s rules, but logically your `foo` array has now numbers in it (which you might not expect). Scary.\n\nSo TS gives you power, but also begs you to pay attention. If I want safer, I might use `readonly string[]` or avoid that mutation. (One of my dev regrets: I didn’t use readonly arrays earlier.)\n\n---\n\n### My “aha!” moments & little tips\n\nHere are some bits I picked up that really helped me stop banging my head:\n\n- If you want to catch extra props always, try to annotate variables explicitly rather than letting TS infer, especially with literals. The moment you introduce a variable, sometimes the excess check is skipped.\n- Use **spreads** carefully. Spreads sometimes “hide” excess props, which might be what you want, but sometimes what you _don’t want_, so know when it happens.\n- Consider tools / lint rules. There are TS/ESLint rules that enforce stricter property checks, type assertions policies etc. These help keep things consistent.\n- Be conservative with `object`, `{}` etc. If you know your data shape, define interface/type. Don’t default to “anything goes.” Saves future debugging.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts (because I'm still learning!)\n\nHonestly, understanding these quirks felt like unlocking secret levels in TS. Sometimes I feel TS is beautiful, other times it's like one more trap waiting. But the more I write, experiment, make mistakes (omg so many), the more these behavior patterns stick.\n\nIf you’re a beginner: don’t let it discourage you. It’s OK to get weird errors. Try small isolated examples like above. Try modifying them and see what TS complains about. Throw in a spread, move to variable first, assign literal, pass directly to function — see where TS flips. That kind of play is what taught me.\n\nIf you want, I can write up a mini-cheat sheet you can keep open, with all these “when does excess prop check happen / when not / object vs {} etc.” Want me to drop that?\n\n[1]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Documentation - Object Types\"\n[2]: https://www.allthingstypescript.dev/p/mid-week-scoop-understanding-excess/comments?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Mid-week Scoop: Understanding Excess Property Checking in ...\"\n[3]: https://dev.to/dipakahirav/differences-between-object-and-object-in-typescript-4cca?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Differences Between Object, {}, and object in TypeScript\"\n[4]: https://type-level-typescript.com/articles/difference-between-object-types-in-typescript?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"what's the difference between object and {} in TypeScript?\"\n[5]: https://jser.dev/typescript/2023/01/12/typescript-object-Object/?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"`{}` vs `object` vs `Object` in TypeScript.\"","src/content/blog/typescript-best-practices/index.md",[3257],"9d6183c53b6e5eb2",{"html":3736,"metadata":3737},"\u003Cp>Hey friends — I’ve been fiddling with TypeScript lately, trying to understand all those little gotchas.

I’d been hearing the hype for a while — “static sites are the future,” “zero JS by default,” blah blah. Honestly, I ignored it at first because I thought: _ugh another shiny framework_. But then I actually tried it. And omg… it’s kinda magical. ✨\n\n---\n\n## Why Astro Feels Different\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\n- It ships **zero JavaScript by default** (like, literally none unless you ask for it 👀).\n- It’s **framework agnostic**, so I can mix React, Svelte, Vue, or just plain HTML.\n- It uses this cool **“islands architecture”** where only the parts of the page that _need_ to be interactive load JS.\n- Plus, it has all the boring-but-important stuff built in: image optimization, bundling, etc. (aka things I’m too lazy to set up myself).\n\nBasically: faster sites, less setup, less crying.\n\n---\n\n## 🌴 The Islands Thing\n\nThe “islands” concept blew my mind. Instead of blasting JS everywhere like a firehose, you can be picky:\n\n```jsx\n\u003CInteractiveComponent client:load />  // hydrate immediately\n\u003CLazyComponent client:visible />      // hydrate when it shows up\n\u003CInteractiveChart client:idle />      // hydrate only when user interacts\n```\n\nSelective hydration = chef’s kiss. 👨‍🍳👌\n\n---\n\n## Mixing React with Astro (Yes Please)\n\nAstro makes React integration ridiculously easy. Like:\n\n```astro\n---\nimport Layout from \"../layouts/Layout.astro\";\nimport InteractiveCounter from \"../components/Counter.jsx\";\n---\n\n\u003CLayout>\n\t\u003Ch1>Static Stuff 🚧\u003C/h1>\n\t\u003Cp>All this is rendered at build time\u003C/p>\n\n\t\u003CInteractiveCounter client:load />\n\t{/* But this is React doing React things */}\n\u003C/Layout>\n```\n\nSo yeah, I get my blazing fast static pages **plus** React interactivity where I want it. Best of both worlds, Hannah Montana style 🎤.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Speed (and Other Nerdy Benefits)\n\nBecause Astro generates mostly static HTML/CSS:\n\n- Pages load way faster ⚡\n- Google SEO bots actually see stuff (yay rankings)\n- Core Web Vitals? Green across the board 💚\n- Hosting bills? Basically pocket change (static files are cheap).\n\n---\n\n## Some Lessons I Learned (The Hard Way lol)\n\n1. Don’t sprinkle `client:load` everywhere like parmesan. Use it only when you need interactivity.\n2. Astro’s image optimization = free speed boost. Use it.\n3. Code splitting is automatic, so no need to overthink it.\n4. Build static first → sprinkle React magic later.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nIf you’re like me — someone who loves React but also wants blazing fast sites — Astro is _chef’s kiss_. 💫 It’s perfect for blogs, portfolios, or just messing around with side projects.\n\nNot gonna lie, I was skeptical at first. But after tinkering with it, I’m sold.
