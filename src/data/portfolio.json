Whether it was planning upcoming work, breaking down complex tasks, or ensuring that we stayed aligned as a team, he always took initiative and pushed our projects forward with clarity and structure. He played a huge role in making sure we kept our documentation in good shape—something that had a real, long-term impact on the maintainability of our codebase.\n He’s also someone who brings a lot of honesty and integrity to discussions. He is never afraid to speak up, challenge assumptions, or offer a different perspective. And even in cases where the team decided on a direction he personally disagreed with, he would still put in the work needed to make the solution succeed. That combination of high moral standards, transparency, and responsibility is rare and incredibly valuable.\n Another strength I really appreciated was his innovative mindset. He constantly explored new technologies, shared knowledge with the team, and helped us adopt better tools and practices. His curiosity and willingness to teach others made a big difference in how our team evolved. \n Beyond all the technical excellence, he’s simply a great colleague—supportive, dependable, and someone you can trust both in day-to-day work and during high-pressure moments. \n I highly recommend Ehsan. He elevates the people around him, drives work forward with professionalism and courage, and would be an asset to any team lucky enough to have him."

We have had many great moments discussing programming and problem-solving, most recently in a project involving React and NextJS. In summary, I consider Ehsan to be a very skilled and motivated programmer. His technical expertise, commitment to self-improvement, and remarkable teamwork make him an indispensable member of any organization. I have no doubt that Ehsan will continue to make significant contributions and achieve great success in his future endeavors. I would not hesitate to have Ehsan as a colleague again in the future."

He was very well-liked by his colleagues and contributed a lot of valuable input regarding various aspects of web development and system development in general. I can highly recommend Ehsan for almost anything related to system development, both backend and frontend. If there’s ever something he doesn’t already know, he will learn it quickly. And he is always welcome back to us at Bredband2 in the future!"

I had the pleasure of working with Ehsan in my two interships at the Guts & Glory, we collaborated on many projects. I was particularly impressed by Ehsan´s ability to handle even the toughest projects effortlessly. That skill often takes years to develop among developers professionals, but it seemed to come perfectly naturally to him. And I still miss working with him! As a team member or a leader, Ehsan earns my highest recommendation."

Hard work under intense time pressure and with a non-existent budget was no obstacle for Ehsan. Thank you!"
