Even though we started out in different teams, Ehsan has always been open to discussing both problems and solutions. Over the past two years, Ehsan and I have worked closely together on a variety of projects, each differing in size and complexity. Besides his excellent ability to break down tasks and problems and provide high quality code to efficiently solve even the most demanding task we have had, Ehsan also has the ability to convey the essence of a problem and explain both the ‘how’ and the ‘why’ it should be solved to junior devs as well as customers alike. But working with Ehsan is also challenging in the best possible way. He is always on the lookout for new tech and ideas, on how to do things better. This is something from which everyone in our team has benefitted from. Over a great many cups of tea, we have discussed how to approach problems, potential pitfalls and best practices. I’m sure that Ehsan’s knowledge, curiosity and sense of teamwork will be a great asset to any organisation and I envy the next developer who gets to pick his brain. - It’s always time for tea…"

And let me tell you – I don’t think I’ve ever met someone as passionate and knowledgeable about “everything code” as him! Working with Ehsan means constantly being introduced to new ideas and interesting innovations. It’s about being challenged (in a good way!) in your ways of thinking, to find creative and efficient solutions to complex problems, and being confident that the code your team produces will adhere to best practices. But above all, it’s an absolute blast. Ehsan possesses the ability to see the whole picture, which enables him to produce quality products – even if the brief is a bit fuzzy. He has an eagerness to share his expertise and has, on countless occasions, made both our team and our department better by doing so. He also has a keen eye for design, which has made my job as a designer so much easier. Replacing him in our team will be a struggle, and I do hope our professional paths cross again in the future. To anyone who has the opportunity to work with him: I’m jealous."

Han har en bra förmåga att snabbt sätta sig in i problemen som skall lösas och använda befintlig eller samla nya kunskaper för att lösa dessa. Vi har haft många bra stunder där vi har diskuterat programmering och problemlösning, nu senast i ett projekt involverat React och NextJS. Sammanfattningsvis anser jag Ehsan som en mycket skicklig och motiverad programmerare. Hans tekniska expertis, engagemang för självförbättring och anmärkningsvärda lagarbete gör dem till en oumbärlig medlem i alla organisationer. Jag tvivlar inte på att Ehsan kommer att fortsätta att ge betydande bidrag och nå stora framgångar i sina framtida ansträngningar. Skulle inte tveka att ha Ehsan som kollega igen i framtiden."
