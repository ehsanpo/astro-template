A React Native/Expo mobile application that encodes text into the Pigpen cipher, a geometric substitution cipher also known as the Freemason's cipher.

<h3>📱 Features</h3>

- **Text Encoding**: Convert any text into Pigpen cipher symbols
- **Visual Display**: Beautiful SVG-based cipher symbols
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on iOS, Android, and Web
- **Real-time Conversion**: See your text transform into cipher symbols instantly

<h3>🔤 About Pigpen Cipher</h3>

The Pigpen cipher is a substitution cipher that replaces letters with symbols. Each letter is represented by a portion of a grid or crosses, creating a unique visual encoding system. This cipher was historically used by Freemasons and other secret societies.

<h3>🛠️ Technology Stack</h3>

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile development
- **Expo SDK 36**: Development platform and tools
- **React Navigation**: Navigation library
- **React Native SVG**: Vector graphics rendering
- **Jest**: Testing framework

<h3>🚀 Key Challenges Solved</h3>

- **SVG Rendering**: Implemented custom SVG components for cipher symbols
- **Real-time Encoding**: Built efficient text-to-symbol conversion algorithm
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Ensured consistent experience across iOS, Android, and Web
- **Legacy Node.js Support**: Configured scripts with OpenSSL legacy provider for compatibility
