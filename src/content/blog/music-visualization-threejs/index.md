Iâ€™ve been experimenting with **music visualization** using Three.js and one of my unreleased tracks. Itâ€™s basically my love for music + web dev mashed together â€” creating visuals that **dance to the beat in real-time**.

_The visuals respond to the audio frequency â€” move your mouse, change the song, enjoy the chaos!_

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Three.js** â†’ 3D graphics & WebGL
- **Web Audio API** â†’ real-time audio analysis
- **Vanilla JS** â†’ keeping it simple

Key features:

- Particle systems reacting to bass, mids, highs
- Color palettes that shift with music energy
- Smooth animations synchronized to beats

---

## ðŸ’¡ How I Built It

1. **Audio Analysis** â†’ grab frequency data with Web Audio API
2. **3D Scene** â†’ particles in Three.js respond to frequencies
3. **Animation Loop** â†’ update visuals every frame to match audio

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Creative Decisions

- Cool colors for calm sections, warm colors for intense parts
- Momentum-based particle motion for natural flow
- Less = more â€” simple effects often look better than over-the-top chaos

---

## âš¡ Challenges

- **Performance** â†’ solved with instanced particles, optimized shaders, adaptive quality
- **Audio sync** â†’ low-latency audio + multiple frequency bands
- **Cross-browser issues** â†’ feature detection & fallbacks

---

## âœ¨ What I Learned

- Smooth visuals > flashy but laggy
- Frequency analysis reveals hidden patterns in music
- Colors and motion dramatically affect mood
- Interactive elements make people feel connected

---

## ðŸ”® Future Fun

- VR/AR support for full immersion
- Multi-track visualization for complex songs
- User-customizable colors & effects
- Export features & social sharing

This project is my playground where **code meets creativity**. Music visualization isnâ€™t just pretty lights â€” itâ€™s about **translating audio into emotion**, finding patterns, and creating interactive experiences.

_Code is on GitHub â€” tweak it, remix it, make your own musical visual world._
