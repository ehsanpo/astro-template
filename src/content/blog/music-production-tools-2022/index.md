Lately, I‚Äôve been using AI to speed up music production. Not to _compose_ music (yet üòÖ), but for all the little annoying stuff that normally eats hours.

Here‚Äôs my **modern workflow** for remixing a song:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Get Your Software

Grab your DAW or VSTs ‚Äî I usually check [Professional Audio Software Blog](https://audioz.download/).
_Pro tip: support devs when you can!_

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Chords

- **[Chordify](https://chordify.net/)** ‚Üí instant chord progressions. Saves tons of ear training time.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Extract Vocals

- **[Acapella-extractor.com](http://acapella-extractor.com/)** ‚Üí free
- **[LALAL.AI](https://www.lalal.ai/)** ‚Üí premium, AI-powered stem separation

Separate vocals, drums, bass, etc. Perfect for remixing!

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Master Your Track

- **[Bakuage](https://bakuage.com/en/)**
- **[LANDR](https://www.landr.com/)**

No more guessing EQ and compression ‚Äî AI analyzes and masters your track.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Visuals & Cover Art

- **[Butterchurn Visualizer](https://butterchurnviz.com/)** ‚Üí mesmerizing audio-reactive visuals
- **[Kaleidosync](https://www.kaleidosync.com/visualizer)** ‚Üí Spotify-connected
- **[WOMBO Dream](https://app.wombo.art/)** ‚Üí AI-generated cover art (type a prompt, get instant art!)

Social media loves visuals ‚Äî these tools make it effortless.

## ‚ö° My Actual Workflow

1. Browse Spotify for inspiration
2. Extract vocals with LALAL.AI
3. Analyze chords with Chordify
4. Produce remix in DAW
5. Quick master with Bakuage
6. Make a visual with Butterchurn
7. Generate cover art with WOMBO
8. Upload to SoundCloud/Spotify

Boom ‚Äî hours of work condensed into a day.

## üîÆ Why It Matters

AI tools remove boring technical barriers, letting bedroom producers compete with pros. You learn faster, iterate faster, and focus on the fun stuff ‚Äî creativity.

The challenge now? Standing out. The ocean of content is massive.
